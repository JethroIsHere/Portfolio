## üìñ About The Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is a fully responsive, multi-page static site designed from the ground up to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements as a Computer Science student majoring in Artificial Intelligence.

The design is centered around a modern, celestial "outer space" theme, utilizing a **glassmorphism** aesthetic, dynamic animations, and interactive elements to create an engaging user experience.
