# Portfolio

Jethro Roland Danocup - Personal Portfolio Website 
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's a fully
responsive, multi-page site designed to showcase my skills, projects,
and achievements as a Computer Science student and aspiring developer.

## Features

This portfolio is built with modern web technologies and includes a
range of aesthetic and functional features to create an engaging user
experience.

### Design & Aesthetics

-   **Consistent Color Palette**: A unified color scheme is used across
    all pages for a professional look.
-   **Glassmorphism UI**: Key content areas use a semi-transparent,
    blurred background effect for a modern, layered appearance.
-   **Dynamic Animated Background**: The homepage features a subtle,
    moving particle animation created with three.js.
-   **Animated Gradient Headings**: Major headings have a shimmering
    gradient effect to draw attention.
-   **Interactive Hover Effects**: Project and achievement cards lift up
    on hover, providing satisfying visual feedback.
-   **Rounded Corners**: All images and cards have rounded corners for a
    soft, modern design.
-   **Improved Typography**: Text is optimized for readability with
    improved line spacing.

### Functionality & UX

-   **Fully Responsive**: The layout adapts seamlessly to all screen
    sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
-   **Sticky Navigation Bar**: The header remains fixed at the top of
    the page for easy navigation.
-   **Responsive Mobile Menu**: On smaller screens, the navigation
    collapses into a full-screen overlay menu.
-   **Reveal-on-Scroll Animations**: Content sections, images, and cards
    smoothly slide up as they enter the viewport.
-   **Dynamic "Typing" Effect**: The homepage sub-heading types itself
    out for an interactive introduction.
-   **Dynamic Copyright Year**: The copyright year in the footer
    automatically updates to the current year using JavaScript.

## Tech Stack

-   **HTML5**
-   **CSS3** (with Flexbox and Grid for layout)
-   **JavaScript (ES6)**
-   **three.js** (for the homepage particle animation)
